          One third of all food produced is lost or wasted. Around 1.3 billion
          tonnes of food per year. Here at Waste Not! we are passionate about
          reducing food waste. By providing everyone a platform to upload food
          that they don't need. Allowing others to not have to skip a meal.
          Waste Not! was created by Kylie Gilbert, Luis Debourg and Peter
          O'Callaghan
